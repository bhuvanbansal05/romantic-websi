        <h2>My Feelings</h2>
        <p>There are times when I feel uncertain, like I’m caught between two worlds. There are moments when you give me all your attention, making me feel special and important. Those moments are the ones I hold closest to my heart, like little treasures.</p>
        <p>But then, there are times when I feel like I don’t matter as much. When I don’t hear from you for a while, or when I’m left wondering if I’m truly significant to you. It’s during these times that I can’t help but feel a little lost and sad. Maybe it's just me overthinking, or maybe it’s something deeper that I can’t quite express, but these feelings are real.</p>
        <p>I just wish for consistency, for moments when I feel like I’m truly seen and valued, just as much as I try to make you feel the same way.</p>
