        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m someone who believes in the magic of moments, the beauty of words, and the power of connection. Every day, I find myself thinking of you, wondering when we’ll finally meet. Until then, I’ll treasure every message, every conversation, and the dream of seeing you in person.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> "True love is not about how many days, months, or years you have been together. It’s about how much you love each other every single day."</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> I’m a selectively social person. I talk to only a few people, and for the rest, I might come across as rude. But that’s just how I am; only the ones who really matter get to know the real me.</p>
