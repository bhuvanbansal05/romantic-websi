        <h2>About You</h2>
        <p>Paridhi, you’re the kind of person who lights up any room just by being there. Your laughter is like music, and your smile is the kind that can make the hardest days feel brighter. There’s a magic in your presence that’s hard to describe but impossible to forget.</p>
        <p>Every word you speak, every gesture you make, is like poetry in motion. You’re a perfect balance of strength and grace, sweetness and charm. No one could ever make me feel the way you do, and I can’t help but be mesmerized by everything about you.</p>
        <p><strong>In short:</strong> You’re beautiful, inside and out. And I feel incredibly lucky to even be a part of your world.</p>
